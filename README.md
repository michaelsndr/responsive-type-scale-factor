# Responsive Type Scale Factor
In the spirit of fluid typography, a type scale that is flatter in smaller viewports and progressively steeper in larger ones.

There is now also an SCSS version without JavaScript, but it relies on media queries and isn't fluid. You can still make things smoother, by simply increasing the number of media queries via a variable indicated in the comments. If you know how to make it fluid without JavaScript (or have other ideas for improvements) I would be happy to hear from you.
